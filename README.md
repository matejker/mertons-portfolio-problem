# Merton's Portfolio Problem
In this notebook we try to determine how to _optimally_ distribute your capital over 2 equity stocks and a bond with fix interest rate $r$.
We model Merton's portfolio problem using equity stocks of Google (`GOOGL`) and Tesla (`TSLA`), where we estimate the trends $\mu$ and
volatilities $\sigma$, which we fit to the _Black-Scholes_ model.

In order to measure _investor's_ utility, we used utility function $U(x) = \frac{x^{\gamma}}{\gamma}$. To find an optimal allocation
and maximalize expectation, we used dynamic programming principle and _Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman_ equation.

This project was final assignment for the _Intermediate Stochastic analysis_ course at Department of Mathematics and Its 
Applications at Central European University.
